# BONSAI-ontology-RDF-framework
Recommendations and discussions on ontology and RDF framework development
Dear all 
There has been a lot of interesting feedback regarding the development of a minimal ontology for BONSAI. This repo has been created to create a common platform for all of the discussions (moving away from a chain of messages/ emails).
The repo currently contains:
1) The schema proposed by Matteo
2) A summary of the discussions we have had on groups.io
